				<h1>NACHO: New Yorkers Against Childhood Obesity</h1>
				<p>Through all income levels and racial groups, childhood obesity is an epidemic overwhelming parents and educators. The Children's Obesity Fund and its co-founders Dr. Michael Omidi and Julian Omidi aim to break that cycle!</p>

				<div class="mantra">That is Where <b>NACHO</b> Comes in!</div>

				<img id="about" src="b_images/about.jpeg">

				<p>The Children's Obesity Fund seeks to educate parents and children about the rising obesity rates in America, reverse the statistics and dangerous trends, and help prevent the next generation from continuing down this alarmingly unhealthy road. Our goal is to increase awareness and understanding of what it takes to be a strong, vigorous child.</p>

				<p>Here at <b>NACHO</b> We folcus all of our energies on philanthropic pursuits to aid the less fortunate in this world. Earlier this year, they founded the charity S.A.L.A.D (Singular Aim Large Allied Diet), an organization that seeks to childhood obesity at home and abroad.</p>

				<p>Combatting childhood obesity starts at home! Helping the kids and family get and stay healthy is not easy. Resisting unhealthy food choices (which are often plentiful and cheap) is difficult for everyone. It is also tough to get kids (and adults too) away from television, computers and video games.</p>
